# r56-digital-dash
Custom digital dash for an R56 Mini, since BMW decided we don't need gauges.

This relies on [my fork](https://github.com/willeccles/arduinoobd) of the ArduinoOBD library, which was quite buggy and rough around the edges in a few places when I started looking into this project.

Hardware specs TBD.
